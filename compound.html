        <p>Rippling has quickly become a blueprint for the future of software companies. Parker was early to offer a fully integrated platform by bundling multiple tools into one convenient software. This saves buyers from drowning in a flood of point solutions. Software has finally caught up to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05asIH-Yjao">bundling strategy Comcast</a> popularized in the '90s.<br><br>

            But it's 2025, and the cost of developing software approaches zero.<br>
            So what can you do?<br><br>

            Attack all of your customers' spend, all at once (Rippling addresses Payroll, HR, Benefits, etc.). Focusing on a single product will turn you obsolete before you get the chance to scale.<br><br>

            Turn every customer want into a new product.<br>
            Bring them together in a unified platform.<br>
            Assign a single owner per product.<br>
            Talented engineers, armed with Claude code, will thrive when they own it end-to-end.<br>
            Make sales calls magical.<br>
            Train your sales team to code.<br>
            Let them demo new feature requests live, right on the call.<br>
            Win by breaking the rules.<br><br>

            Believe in magic, and your customers will too.</p>
