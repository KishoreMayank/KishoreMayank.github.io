Whimsy in 2026
February 2026

2025 was relentless. AI advanced at breakneck speed, and 2026 is shaping up to be even bigger. Nobody knows what happens next.

I spent much of 2025 making plans. Spreadsheets. Pro-con lists. Infinitely long Google Docs. I was optimizing for a future I wasn't even sure I wanted.

I woke up one day and started trusting my curiosity. I moved to New York on a whim. Said yes to interesting projects. Surrounded myself with experts in different industries.
There is no safe path anymore. So what do you do?

Be whimsical.

Have fun. Do things that are weird. Do things alone. Do things that scare you, things that make no sense to anyone but you. Figure out what tickles your brain and pay attention to what pulls at your heart. Trust that feeling, it's the only compass you've got.

Don't make elaborate plans. Plans feel responsible. Plans feel safe. But how do you plan for a future that may not exist? Don't do something just because it's "part of the plan." And please, don't do something because your parents or friends told you to.

Think for yourself. Do you think it's dumb? Or does it just not fit within their plan?

I think 2026 is the year to find what you actually love. The world is uncertain. But that uncertainty has a gift: freedom to follow your whims. Chase the unknown. Be a little ridiculous. Find what makes you happy.

Stay whimsical.
