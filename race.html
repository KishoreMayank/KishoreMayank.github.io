        <p>In high-school, I constantly looked to role models. 
            Whether it was Steve Jobs or the older, more accomplished peers at school, I would attempt to copy their paths.<br><br>

            This is a foolish strategy. You will never achieve your potential if you keep reaching for someone else's.<br><br>
            
            Take the NYC marathon. Definitionally, there can only be one winner. But there are over 50,000 people that ran the marathon in 2024. 
            So are they all losers? It depends. Are you running to beat the person in front of you or are you running your own race? 
            Watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/9IiTdSnmS7E?feature=shared&t=513" target="_blank">video from Casey Neistat</a> and you'll know exactly which camp you fall into.<br><br>
            
            Role models can be good. Sometimes you're scrolling through Twitter / X and you 
            watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/hI9HQfCAw64?feature=shared&t=128" target="_blank">impossible become possible</a>. 
            This is inspiring! But you'll never be Elon Musk. You're the only one who gets to be you.<br><br>
            
            Embrace this! Spend the time today, this week, and this month to answer the question: "What do I <strong>ACTUALLY</strong> want to acheive?"<br><br>
            
            It will be a lot easier to win the race if you're the only one running it.</p>
