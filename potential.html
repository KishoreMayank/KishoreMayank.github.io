        <p>On YouTube, there are hidden gems where someone has captured the "last day of high school, year XXXX". 
            My favorite one to watch is "<a href="https://youtu.be/98VTC_k-10M?feature=shared" target="_blank">Final Day at GHS: June 1999</a>".<br><br>
            
            I was born that year. In fact, I wasn't even alive when those kids graduated.<br><br>

            Life runs away from you. Obligations pile up, hopes mount, dreams come and go. 
            If you're past HS, you're thinking about all the things you need to do tomorrow, this week, this month to be "on track". 
            I look at the kids in this video, these blank canvases, with their whole futures ahead of them and want to shake them, tell them it'll be ok, tell them they'll figure it out. 
            But what good will it do, they're 43 years old now. But what the hell am I talking about. I'm 25 writing this essay. 
            I'm sure there's a future version of me saying the same thing. "I wish I could tell him that it'll be ok, I'll figure it out". 
            It's funny how hindsight really is 20/20. It's almost blinding because in the future, the past is already determined.<br><br>

            Those videos were always so much fun to watch. I wish I was more of a videographer growing up, I don't have much on video when I was leaving HS. 
            I don't even remember my hopes and dreams, all I knew is that I wanted to do well.<br><br>

            But as I write this out I realize, no matter where you are, you've got the rest of your life in front of you. 
            Maybe the best way to run at life is to imagine that you, in the future, is looking back.<br><br>
            
            What would they tell you to do today?</p>
