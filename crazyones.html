        <p> Here's to the crazy ones.<br>
            The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. <br>
            The round pegs in the square holes. <br>
            The ones who see things differently. <br>
            They're not fond of rules. <br>
            And they have no respect for the status quo. <br>
            You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. <br>
            About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. <br>
            Because they change things. <br>
            They push the human race forward. <br>
            And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. <br>
            Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. <br>
