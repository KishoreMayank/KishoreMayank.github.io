            Ambitious kids hope that by just “doing things”, they can stumble on THE idea.

            Planning can feel fruitless against the unpredictably of life. But the point of a plan isn’t to figure out the next 50 years.

            Planning will sprout ideas you didn’t even know you were looking for.
